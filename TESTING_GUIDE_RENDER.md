## 🔧 Environment Variables Check

Make sure these are set in Render dashboard:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your service "nature-care-impex-1"
3. Click "Environment" tab
4. Verify these variables exist:

```
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://p59050352_db_user:keerthivasan@cluster0.boime9a.mongodb.net/nature_care_impex?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Owner Portal Shows Old Version:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check Render logs for errors

### If Orders Don't Appear:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check if localStorage has orders: `localStorage.getItem('customerOrders')`
4. Verify MongoDB connection in Render logs

### If Track Order Doesn't Work:
1. Make sure you're using the correct Order ID format (NCI-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify order exists in localStorage or database

### If Add Product Fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check image file size (max 5MB)
4. Try using image URL instead of file upload
