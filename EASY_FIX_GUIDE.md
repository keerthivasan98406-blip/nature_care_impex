# 🚀 EASY FIX - Upload Missing Folders to GitHub

## ⚡ **FASTEST METHOD - Use the Batch File**

I created a file called `upload-to-github.bat` for you!

### **Steps:**
1. **Double-click** `upload-to-github.bat` in your project folder
2. **Wait** for it to finish (it will upload css, js, and assets folders)
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild
4. **Refresh** your website: https://keerthivasan98406-blip.github.io/nature_care_impex

**Done!** ✅

## 🌐 **ALTERNATIVE - Use GitHub Website (No Commands)**

If the batch file doesn't work, use GitHub's web interface:

### **Step 1: Go to Your Repository**
Open: https://github.com/keerthivasan98406-blip/nature_care_impex

### **Step 2: Upload CSS Folder**
1. Click **"Add file"** button (top right)
2. Click **"Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop** the `css` folder from your computer
   - Location: `C:\Users\Keerthivasan.A\OneDrive\real time project\real coco\css`
4. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**

### **Step 3: Upload JS Folder**
1. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"** again
2. **Drag and drop** the `js` folder
   - Location: `C:\Users\Keerthivasan.A\OneDrive\real time project\real coco\js`
3. Click **"Commit changes"**

### **Step 4: Upload Assets Folder**
1. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"** again
2. **Drag and drop** the `assets` folder
   - Location: `C:\Users\Keerthivasan.A\OneDrive\real time project\real coco\assets`
3. Click **"Commit changes"**

### **Step 5: Wait and Check**
1. Wait **2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild
2. Go to: https://keerthivasan98406-blip.github.io/nature_care_impex
3. Press **Ctrl+F5** to hard refresh
4. Your site should now be fully styled! 🎉
