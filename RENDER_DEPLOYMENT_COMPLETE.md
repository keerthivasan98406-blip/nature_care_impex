## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Build Fails:**

**Error: "Root directory 'server' does not exist"**
- **Fix**: Leave "Root Directory" EMPTY in Render settings
- Use Build Command: `cd server && npm install`

**Error: "Cannot find module"**
- **Fix**: Make sure `server/package.json` exists in your repo
- Check GitHub: https://github.com/keerthivasan98406-blip/nature_care_impex/tree/main/server

**Error: "MongoDB connection failed"**
- **Fix**: Check your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Make sure IP whitelist includes `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all)
- Verify username and password are correct

### **If Site is Slow:**
- Free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Upgrade to Starter plan ($7/month) for always-on
